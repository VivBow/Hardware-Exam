Schematics Explanation:
There are 4 main pieces to the controller, the 2 button inputs to control Hide and Take off respectively (These use LED's within the schemtics to show they function), a vibration motor for when you take off to tell you you are now in the air or on the ground (a button is used to test the vibration motor and show it is working), and a gryoscope/accelerometer for basic movement with the controller (this is displayed using an 8-pin header).These fit the 2 inputs, 1 sensor, and 1 actuator requirements while also showing the basic components for a working controller that should function for a simple game such as being the duck in duck hunt.
